# odin-landingpage

The task of this project within the Odin Project Bootcamp was to build a landing page with Flex elements from the very beginning. All that was specified was a harmonizing colour set and an image of what the finished landing page should look like. 

The finished page is responsive.

The technologies used were HTML and CSS.
